# Ascii-Art
Collection of ascii art made by me

!I can actually make some ascii art for you iif you have a flat black and white picture of something it can be whatever you want. The best ones are like cartoon pictures cause its the easiest ones to make 2d ascii art from cause theyre already 2d!


If you see any $ signs or something like $1 or ${c1} it means the art was made for fastfetch or neofetch those $ signs mean which color should be used for that line of text.
You can delete the signs or leave them if youre using your ascii art for fastfetch because then its gonna be more colorful instead of just one color

Especially check the OpenSUSE ones and Arch ones cause theyre like distro specific and the right size for neofetch and fastfetch so u can use them as a logo for them.

One more thing Im actually really poor. I dont want to beg or anything but can you spare few cents in crypto? And ill make sure ill do much more ascii art in the near future.
