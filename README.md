# Ascii-Art
Collection of ascii art made by me


If you see any $ signs or something like $1 or ${c1} it means the art was made for fastfetch or neofetch those $ signs mean which color should be used for that line of text.
You can delete the signs or leave them if youre using your ascii art for fastfetch because then its gonna be more colorful instead of just one color
